# Folders

**Displays a list of folders that contains story templates.**

This documentation covers the following

- [index.jsx](indexjsx)
- [config.json](configjson)
- [transformResponse.js](transformResponsejs)
- [Markup.jsx](Markupjsx)
- [Preview.jsx](Previewjsx)

## index.js

Having a 'folders' abstraction that organises story templates allows users to progressively disclose story templates depending on topics.

The list of folders and their corresponding story templates are dynamically fetched from a headless Wordpress endpoint in the client. On initial load the page will display a loading animation until the most up to date folder information has been retrieved.

## config.json

Contains the hardcoded url path that the Axios should hit.

## transformResponse.js

This function removes all the values that are not needed from the Wordpress response and structures it into a model that is closer to the UI structure. It is plugged directly into the Axios request so that data is immediately returned in a formatted manner.

Note that in the example below and the function's associated tests, the input is forced into a string, since the endpoint exposes a string that first needs to be parsed in JSON.

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <code>
      <pre>
        {JSON.stringify(transformResponseMock, 0, 2)}
      </pre>
    </code>
    <hr />
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <code>
      <pre>
        {JSON.stringify(transformResponse(JSON.stringify(transformResponseMock)), 0, 2)}
      </pre>
    </code>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>


## Markup.jsx

Renders the user-facing UI based on the values that were retrieved by the `Folders` component.

<PropsTable of={Markup} />

### Preview.jsx

Component that styles the `code` tag to distinguish it from the actual UI.
