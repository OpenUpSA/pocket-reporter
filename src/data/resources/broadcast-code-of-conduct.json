This is to ensure that the country is not caught napping by 2015 when the whole world is expected to have gone digital.\n\nThe advent of digitization and its emerging new media, no doubt, pose a new set of challenges on the industry. Therefore to meet up with the challenges of the emerging trend in the broadcast industry, there is need to have a proper and workable regulatory framework that would guide the operators in the industry.\n\nThe fifth edition of the Nigeria Broadcasting Code, therefore updates the rules and regulations of broadcasting in the country to make operators responsive to the developments that are constantly affecting the industry.\n\nFor several months, veteran broadcasters from across the country, professionals in broadcast industry, scholars from tertiary institutions that offer Mass Communication and other interested members of the public met and deliberated on the provisions of the Code especially the aspect of digitization and democratization of the airwaves.\n\nApart from reviewing the Code as a mere fulfillment of the provisions of the law, emphasis are laid on certain aspects that will impact on digital broadcasting which include Community Broadcasting, Network Licence, Broadcast Content etc.\n\nIn view of the emerging trend, there is the need for effective and efficient spectrum management and Nigeria can no longer afford to waste frequencies, hence the need to have structured and approved guidelines in issuance of broadcast licence.\n\nAlso Democracy has come to stay in Nigeria, and as such broadcast stations are to adhere strictly to the rules and regulations of broadcasting industry which are contained in the Code. In the area of social responsibility, the industry has a major role to play in promoting culture and values of the people and therefore should be in forefront in the fight against social ills by improving on the local contents.\n\nThe Code will therefore assist broadcasters to make sound judgements and build credibility in providing the public with power to make important decisions to serve the society in an ethically responsible and constructive manner.\n\nWhile stressing the need for government’s approval for the implementation of digitization, the nation looks forward to a full-blown community broadcasting as stipulated in the Code.\n\nIn conclusion, the Code is written in concise language for all segments of the society. This is to enable stakeholders in the industry to discharge their responsibility more effectively and provide transparent tool for the Commission to adequately regulate the industry.\n\nThe Commission expresses profound gratitude to all those who worked tirelessly to make the Code review a huge success.\n\n**Yomi Bolarinwa, fnse**\n\n**Director General**\n\n**National Broadcasting Commission**\n\n**October, 2010**\n\n0.1    **INTRODUCTION**\n\nThe **Code** represents the minimum standard for broadcasting in the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The **Code** shall be applied in the spirit as well as in the letter, in accordance with the professional ideals of broadcasting.\n\n0.1.1 **GENERAL PRINCIPLES**\n\n0.1.1.1 **Character of Broadcasting**\n\nBroadcasting is a creative medium, characterized by professionalism, choice and innovation, to serve the interest of the general public. Its utilisation of audio and video technology makes it capable of reaching the audience simultaneously, availing mankind with the best means of information dissemination and reception. It also enables the individual to share in and contribute, to the best of his ability, to the world around him.\n\nBroadcasting shall influence society positively, setting the agenda for the social, cultural, economic, political and technological development of a nation, for the public good.\n\nBy means of broadcasting, every Nigerian is expected to partake in sharing of ideas and experiences that will enrich his or her life and help him or her live in a complex, dynamic and humane society, as envisaged in Chapter two of the _1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria_ (hereinafter referred to as the **Constitution**).\n\nNigerian broadcasting shall essentially match the best in the profession anywhere in the world, yet be distinctly Nigerian, projecting the best and discouraging the worst in the society. In other words, the cardinal responsibility of broadcasting to inform, educate and entertain shall not be at the expense of national interest, unity and cohesion of Nigeria’s diverse social, cultural, economic, political and religious configurations.\n\nTherefore, no broadcast shall intentionally encourage or incite to crime, lead to public disorder, be repugnant to public feeling or contain an offensive reference to any person, alive or dead, or generally, be disrespectful to human dignity.\n\n0.1.1.2 **Objectives of Broadcasting**\n\na. Broadcasting shall be guided by the following broad objectives, which are in line with the Fundamental Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy, as set out in chapter two of the **1999 Constitution**.\n\nb. Broadcasting shall provide an efficient, professional and comprehensive service to the entire people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria based on national objectives and aspirations.\n\n0.1.1.2.1  **Social Objectives**\n\nTo provide a functional level of enlightenment for the Nigerian populace, irrespective of their educational background. Specifically, broadcasting is to:\n\ni. promote generally accepted social values and norms, especially civic and social responsibilities;\n\nii. promote the acquisition or pursuit of knowledge;\n\niii. disseminate, impartially, news and opinions in a manner encouraging meaningful and articulate dialogue and discussion of issues of public interest;\n\niv. promote the physical, mental and social well-being of the people;\n\nv. foster the spirit of self-discipline, self-sacrifice and self-reliance; and\n\nvi. encourage respect for the dignity of man.\n\nb. Broadcasting organizations shall recognize that they exercise freedom of expression as agents of society, not for any personal or sectional rights, privileges and needs of their own or of their proprietors, relatives, friends or supporters.\n\nc. Broadcasting shall promote values and norms, which foster the well- being and co-operation of the various groups of the Nigerian society.\n\n0.1.1.2.2 **Cultural Objectives**\n\nThe cultural objectives of broadcasting shall encompass various aspects of community life including aesthetics, religion, ethics, philosophy, language, history and the arts. Therefore, broadcasting shall:\n\na. provide, through programming, a service essential to the maintenance and enhancement of national identity and cultural sovereignty;\n\nb. serve to safeguard, enrich and strengthen the cultural, political, social and economic fabrics of Nigeria;\n\nc. seek, identify, preserve and promote Nigeria’s diverse cultures;\n\nd. select critically, the positive aspects of foreign cultures for the purpose of enriching the Nigerian culture;\n\ne. develop and promote the application of indigenous aesthetic values;\n\nf. promote the development of a high level of intellectual and artistic creativity; and\n\ng. foster generally acceptable moral, ennobling and spiritual values.\n\n0.1.1.2.3 **Economic Objectives**\n\na.The economic objectives of broadcasting shall be consistent with the nation’s economic goals, which include the building of:\n\ni.a united, strong and self-reliant nation;\n\nii.a just and egalitarian society;\n\niii.a great and dynamic economy; and\n\niv.a land bright and full of opportunities for all\n citizens.\n\nb.Broadcasting shall, therefore:\n\ni.monitor trends and developments in production processes;\n\nii.promote knowledge of available products and services through programmes and advertisements;\n\niii.foster the spirit of hard-work and productivity to improve the quality of life of the people; and\n\niv.encourage the production and consumption of local product to achieve self-sufficiency and self-reliance.\n\n0.1.1.2.4 **Political Objectives**\n\nBroadcasting shall contribute to the development of national unity and participatory democracy. Therefore, the political objectives of broadcasting shall be to:\n\na. create and promote political awareness amongst the people in order to achieve a democratic society;\n\nb. inculcate in the people the spirit of tolerance of all shades of opinion; and\n\nc. promote social justice based on the responsibilities and rights of the individuals in society.\n\n0.1.1.2.5 **Technological Objectives**\n\nThe nation’s abundant natural and human resources shall be exploited to the advantage of the people. Broadcasting shall therefore:\n\na. keep the people abreast of technological developments;\n\nb. promote and encourage the study of science and technology;\n\nc. promote the spirit of self-reliance and engender the development of indigenous technology; and\n\nd.promote a scientific and rational attitude to life by encouraging research.\n\n0.1.1.2.6 **Professional Objectives**\n\nBroadcasting as a specialised section of the media industry, with its own mode of professionalism, demands a high level of specialisation and professional skills, some of which are as set out by the **Code**.\n\nBroadcasting, therefore, is to ensure:\n\na.development of professionalism through recruitment and training of personnel, who at the point of entry into senior cadre shall, possess at least, Higher National Diploma (HND) or its equivalent in broadcast related fields;\n\nb.that only professionals with at least 10 years cognate\n experience shall head core departments, divisions or directorates;\n\nc.that only a professional broadcaster, with at least 15 years cognate experience in broadcasting, shall be made Chief Operations Officer of a broadcast station;\n\nd.that Nigerian talents and facilities shall be used as much as possible in the production of programmes, including advertisements; and\n\ne.meaningful investment in research and development, and job security with appropriate remuneration is guaranteed. Therefore, the Commission shall intercede in instances where unjust removal of a broadcaster is established.\n\n0.1.1.3 **The Objectives of Broadcast Regulation**\n\nThis regulation is to ensure that broadcasting plays a pivotal role in the social, cultural, technological, economic, and political lives of the people of Nigeria. To attain this:\n\na. broadcasting shall adhere to the general principles of legality, decency, truth, integrity and respect for human dignity as well as the cultural, moral and social values of the people within the provisions of the Constitution;\n\nb. Nigerian broadcasting shall meet the best in professional standards;\n\nc. the framework for the regulation of broadcasting in Nigeria shall meet local needs without compromising international standards;\n\nd. broadcasting in Nigeria shall provide the entire range of sound and vision services that cater to, and reflect the diverse range of Nigerian cultures and communities through effective distribution of public, commercial and community broadcasting services;\n\ne. broadcasting in Nigeria shall be substantially owned and operated by Nigerians;\n\nf. broadcasting shall ensure the protection and the development of children and other persons requiring special care and consideration;\n\ng. broadcasting shall be mindful of the degree of harm and offence likely to be caused by the inclusion of any material in programming in general or in specific terms;\n\nh. broadcast frequency bands, a scarce resource, shall be efficiently utilized in line with the international best standards in the planning, co-ordination, assignment, registration, and monitoring of the broadcast spectrum;\n\ni. universal access to broadcasting, including technologies, content and services shall be promoted;\n\nj. providers of broadcasting services shall respect community standards in the provision of programme materials;\n\nk. the mechanism for addressing complaints as well as feedback shall be established;\n\nl. broadcasters and their employees shall uphold the rights and\n obligations of the mass media as provided in the\n Constitution;\n\nm. fair and sustainable competition shall be the hallmark of the broadcast industry in Nigeria;\n\nn. self-regulation shall be employed within the framework of professional standards.\n\n0.1.1.4 **Challenges to the Industry.**\n\nThe challenges to the industry are to ensure a free competitive and responsive broadcasting service in Nigeria, and to stimulate the contribution expected of broadcasting in a truly democratic society. Thus broadcasting must satisfy, amongst others, the following needs of society:\n\na. a truthful, comprehensive and intelligent account of each day’s local, regional, national and international events that have significant impact on the Nigerian community;\n\nb. an impartial access to the nation’s daily intelligence, made\n equally available to everyone; c. a forum for the exchange of comment and criticism representing every stratum of the society, as required in a federal state like Nigeria, in which the views and opinions of everyone are included in the national consensus;\n\nd. a means of projecting the opinions and attitudes of the groups in the society to one another, such as the balancing of information flow between the rural and urban, government and the governed, as well as the presentation and clarification of the goals and values of the society;\n\ne. an efficient, professional and comprehensive broadcasting service to the entire people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, based on national objectives and aspirations;\n\nf. an effective coverage and reach of the entire nation;\n\ng. the guaranteed right of practitioners to have control over editorial and programme content in the media;\n\nh. the development of Nigerian artistic creativity and talent in entertainment programming, and offering information and analyses from the Nigerian point of view;\n\ni. programming that promotes employment opportunities to serve the needs and interest, and reflect the circumstances and aspirations of all Nigerians;\n\nj. programming that promotes excellence and high moral and ethical standards acceptable to a substantial group of the viewing and listening public;\n\nk. development of human resources and training, and capacity building within broadcasting;\n\nl. ready adaptation to scientific and technological changes;\n\nm. maximum use of predominantly Nigerian creative resources in the presentation of programming, be it news, programme, musical entertainment, advertising or sponsorships;\n\nn. greater emphasis on the broadcast of news and programmes in Nigerian languages so as to ensure direct relevance to local communities;\n\no. programmes of high professional standard;\n\np. reasonable opportunity for the public to be exposed to all views on matters of public concern; and\n\nq. the development and growth of the independent production sector.\n\n0.1.1.5 **Deregulation of Broadcasting in Nigeria**\n\n0.1.1.5.1 Historically, on August 24, 1992, the Federal Military Government promulgated _the National Broadcasting Commission Decree No. 38_\n (now deemed an Act of the National Assembly) deregulating the broadcast industry and establishing the National Broadcasting Commission to regulate the entire industry. This ended over 50 years of sole government-ownership of broadcasting in the country. The responsibilities of the Commission were further expanded by (Amendment) Decree No. 55 of 1999.\n\n0.1.1.6 **Legal Framework**\n\n0.1.1.6.1 The National Broadcasting Commission (herein referred to as the **Commission**) was established by Section 1 of _the National Broadcasting Commission Act No. 38 of 1992_ (as amended).\n\n0.1.1.6.2 **Responsibility of the Commission**\n\nThe responsibility of the National Broadcasting Commission is as stated in Section 2(1) of NBC Act No. 38 of 1992 (as amended) See Appendix 1.\n\n0.1.1.7 **Declaration**\n\nThe National Broadcasting Commission affirms that it shall co- operate with, encourage and protect stations but would firmly ensure that they adhere to all provisions of the law and the **Code** governing broadcasting in Nigeria.\n\n**CHAPTER ONE**\n\n1.0 **BROADCASTING STANDARD**\n\nThe standard given hereunder stipulates the regulations and\n procedures for developing and enhancing professionalism in\n Nigerian Broadcasting.\n\nCLASS A\n\n1.1 **Principles**\n\n(a) **The Code** contains the universal aims and objectives of broadcasting with specific application to Nigeria.
